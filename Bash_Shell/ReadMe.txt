Welcome to Ryan Neisess' shell!

The rn_sh program is a bash-style shell that supports key shell operations 
	including command/program parsing/searching/execution, input and output 
	redirection, and multiple pipes.

To run the program, run the bash script "instr.sh" in a Linux environment.

For convenience of testing the aforementioned functionalities, a trivial 
	C program, "rt", has been created that accepts three integers as input 
	and outputs the three integers multiplied by 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
	For quick testing, there are no prompts, and the user may simply enter 
	three integers after starting the program, if input is maintained from 
	the keyboard.

Thought has been given to additional convenience features for the shell, and 
	future updates plan to include tab completion as well as using the up and 
	down arrow keys to cycle through previously entered commands, just like 
	the regular bash program on Linux.
